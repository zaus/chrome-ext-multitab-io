# Privacy Policy

This plugin does not export your data, nor share it with anything beyond this plugin.  No external scripts or services are used.  The source code is all here, so you can see what it does: read tab information to show in an internal popup, and use the links in that popup to open new tabs.

The only persistant data is plugin options saved to `localStorage`.
