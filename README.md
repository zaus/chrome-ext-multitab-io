Multitab (tab-snap)
===================

Based on [Tab-Snap](https://github.com/tdj28/tab-snap), the "Open-Source Chrome Extension for Exporting/Importing Open Tabs + Archiving in Various Formats and File Types".

"Slimmed down" - removed unnecessary functionality, permissions.

Updated for Manifest V3 but no other changes.
